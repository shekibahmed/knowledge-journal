    "title": "AI-Powered Breakthrough in Synthetic Biology — Generative Design of Bacteriophages",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a pioneering leap for synthetic biology, a new preprint on bioRxiv describes how artificial intelligence, through genome language models, has been used to successfully generate, from scratch, entire functional bacteriophage genomes. These advancements, led using the Evo 1 and Evo 2 genome models, represent a foundational breakthrough in the generative design of novel life forms.\n\nBackground: The Power of Genome Language Models\nTraditionally, much of biology’s progress in genetic engineering relied on modifying existing genes or elements. However, assembling whole genomes—taking into account all regulatory, coding, and structural factors—represents a colossal step up in challenge and ambition. Bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are critical both as research models and as tools in developing therapies against antibiotic-resistant superbugs.\n\n\nThe Study: How Did They Do It?\nThe researchers fine-tuned generative AI models on extensive datasets of phage genomes, setting the well-studied E. coli bacteriophage ΦX174 as a design template. The workflow involved:\nTraining genome language models to understand genome-level evolution and structure.\nGenerating thousands of full-length candidate virus genomes with steerable properties (e.g., targeting specific bacteria).\nFiltering these AI-generated sequences for biological viability, diversity, and tropism specificity.\nExperimentally synthesizing and screening ~300 of the best designs.\n\n\nThe Breakthrough: Real, Viable Viruses Engineered by AI\nSixteen totally new synthetic bacteriophages (engineered by AI, never before seen in nature) proved to be functional. Not only did they successfully infect E. coli, but some outperformed the natural template virus, displaying higher lytic ability and greater fitness in competition assays. Cryo-electron microscopy showed that the AI-created viruses could integrate highly mutated or evolutionarily distant elements stably.\nA particularly stunning result was that a cocktail of these novel phages rapidly killed E. coli strains that had become resistant to the natural virus. This points to immense future promise for personalized antibacterial therapies—especially as antibiotic resistance becomes a growing global crisis.\n\n\nWider Implications: A New Era for Synthetic Biology\nThis paper is landmark proof that genome-scale language models can generatively design whole organisms—not just proteins or short sequences—under precisely steerable constraints. The techniques and workflows developed are generalizable, laying the scientific and technological blueprint for:\nAI-driven creation of viruses and potentially larger, more complex living systems.\nRapid prototyping of biotherapeutics customized to emerging pathogens.\nDeep exploration of evolutionary biology and genetics.\n\n\nConclusion: Generative AI’s Impact on the Future of Biology\nThe successful design, experimental synthesis, and therapeutic demonstration of these AI-created viruses marks a transformative moment for science. It redefines the frontier of what is possible with synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, accelerating humanity’s ability to respond to old threats such as antibiotic resistance and to design the biological innovations of tomorrow.\nSource: Repecka, D., Chen, E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The latest version of the Codex CLI interface now supports the new GPT-4-turbo model, which is optimized for both speed and cost-efficiency. This makes it an excellent choice for integrating AI capabilities into various applications, including Quarto documents. It was able to deal with challenges with my codebase very quickly and intuitively. It will take a while to get used to the different modalities in which Codex is available. In some cases it makes sense to use the local version because it can understand all the issues with my codebase really well and in other cases when my device cannot handle the load, I can use the cloud version."
