Voice AI is a tool that overcomes the literacy barrier, enabling individuals who struggle with reading and writing to access information and communicate effectively. This technology has the potential to democratize access to knowledge and services, particularly in underserved communities. This also helps give leverage to people who have strong emotional intelligence but struggle with traditional IQ benchmarks.
